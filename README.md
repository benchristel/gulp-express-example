# Gulp 4 + Express Example

This repo demonstrates my current opinions on how to build an Express webapp using Gulp 4. Currently it is rather complex and possibly slow; expect it to get faster and then simpler.

**Features:**

- Compiles [ES2015](https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/) to backwards-compatible ES3. Sourcemaps included!
- Uses [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) to pack the tree of `require`d files into a single, minified JS file that can be run in a browser.
- Runs tests with [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/2.4/introduction.html).
- [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) enforces [Standard JS style](http://standardjs.com).
- Dependency injection with [Yavanna](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@benchristel/yavanna) makes unit-testing a breeze, and saves you from having to change your `require`s when you want to move or rename a source file.
- The `gulp watch` task rebuilds the app and runs the tests and linter on every file change for the tightest possible feedback loop.

## Getting Started

If you want to use this repo as a template for your own project, you can clone the latest version and reinitialize the repository:

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/benchristel/gulp-express-example.git myproject
cd myproject
mv .git /tmp # because `rm -rf` is for crazy people
git init
```

### Install Node via Homebrew

```bash
brew install node
```

### Install Gulp 4

The `-g` flag installs the CLI globally, making the `gulp` executable available on your `PATH`.

```bash
npm install -g gulpjs/gulp-cli
```

### Install Project Dependencies

```bash
npm install # must be run inside your project directory
```

### Start building!

```bash
gulp watch --silent # suppress gulp output cruft
```

## Possibly missing features

- An option to build a production version of the app with minified browser code (I originally had `uglify` in the normal build pipeline, but it was too slow to use for development)
- A version of the build pipeline that works for published NPM packages, or CLI apps.

## Gotchas

- `gulp check` won't do what you want on CI - the exit code is always zero regardless of what the tests/linter output.
- Because of the way tests are currently run, you can't have different server and browser modules with the same name. For example, if you have a `User` class on the server that's a database model, you can't have a separate `User` class for the browser—the dependency injector will complain that you're registering two modules with the same name.

  Depending on the structure of your team, this constraint on naming may or may not be desirable. It should be possible to run the browser and server tests in separate Jasmine instances so the names don't collide, but I haven't gotten to it yet.
- You will need to upgrade your Gulp CLI to work with Gulp 4, which probably means that you won't be able to build Gulp 3 projects anymore without downgrading Gulp. If you switch between projects frequently, this could be a source of pain.
